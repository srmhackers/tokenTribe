          NFT, a new concept that created hype around digital art, is now ready
          to get involved with various other markets. One such destination is an
          event market where NFTs can connect physical and digital ticketing.
          The transition to a digital world is happening at a rapid pace. NFTs
          implemented for the right use cases can facilitate this transition and
          accelerate the process without any compromise to the current ease of
          operations. <br />
